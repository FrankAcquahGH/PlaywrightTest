# Playwright Test Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for setting up and running automated tests using Playwright. The goal is to ensure consistency, efficiency, and maintainability in the testing process for our project.

---

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js (version 16 or higher) is installed.
   - Verify installation using `node -v` and `npm -v`.
2. **Package Manager**: Use npm or yarn to manage dependencies.
3. **Git**: Ensure Git is installed for version control.
4. **Browser Dependencies**: Install required dependencies for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit based on your operating system. Refer to the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) for details.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project_name>
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

## Test Requirements

### Test Framework
- **Playwright Test**: The primary testing framework for browser automation.
  - Ensure the `@playwright/test` package is installed.

### Test Scenarios
The following test scenarios are required:
1. **User Authentication**:
   - Test login with valid credentials.
   - Verify error messages for invalid credentials.
2. **Navigation and Page Load**:
   - Ensure all main navigation links work.
   - Verify that key pages load within acceptable time limits.
3. **Form Validation**:
   - Check form submission with valid data.
   - Test error handling for invalid input.
4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Validate UI responsiveness across supported screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
5. **API Integration**:
   - Mock API responses and validate UI behavior.

### Test Configuration
- **Browsers**:
  - Chromium, Firefox, WebKit.
- **Devices**:
  - Include desktop and mobile emulations (e.g., iPhone 13, Pixel 5).
- **Environments**:
  - Support multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

├── tests/
│   ├── e2e/          # End-to-end test cases
│   ├── unit/         # Unit test cases (if applicable)
│   └── helpers/      # Shared utilities and test helpers

├── README.md             # Documentation for the project
└── requirement.md        # This requirements file
```

### Configuration File
- Use `playwright.config.ts` to manage test settings such as timeouts, retries, and test directory paths.

---

## CI/CD Integration

### Continuous Integration
- Integrate Playwright tests into the CI pipeline.
- Example tools: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI.

### Example GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

tasks:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: npx playwright test

      - name: Upload test artifacts
        if: failure()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

---

## Best Practices
1. Write descriptive test names.
2. Use `test.beforeAll` and `test.afterAll` for setup/teardown logic.
3. Leverage test retries for handling flaky tests.
4. Use Playwright's debugging tools (e.g., `npx playwright codegen`).
5. Regularly update Playwright to leverage new features and improvements.
